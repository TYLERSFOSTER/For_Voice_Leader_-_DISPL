# Detritus from *Voice Leader - DISPL.*
Notes and notebooks I used to collect thoughts and generate materials for the project *Voice Leader* - *DISPL.*

The two Jupyter notebook files in this repository have a lot of explanatory text throughout.

Might be easiest to start at the notebook [Voice Leading from the Dynamics of Charged Particles.ipynb](Voice Leading from the Dynamics of Charged Particles.ipynb). I think the comments and exposition are clearer and more developed in it. The notebook `Composition 2, Materials notebook.ipynb` is kind of transitional. It began as round-2 of a previous project, but quickly morphed into the project that became *Voice Leader - DISPL.*
