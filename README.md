# Detritus from *Voice Leader - DISPL.*
Notes and notebooks I used to collect thoughts and generate materials for the project *Voice Leader* - *DISPL.*

The two Jupyter notebook files in this repository have a lot of explanatory text throughout.

Might be easiest to start at the notebook *Voice Leading from the Dynamics of Charged Particles.ipynb*. I think the comments and exposition are clearer and more developed in it. The notebook *Composition 2, Materials notebook.ipynb* is kind of transitional, which makes it a little difficult to follow. It began as Round-2 of a previous project, but quickly morphed into the project that became *Voice Leader - DISPL.* The notebook *Euler_Acoustic_Wave 2.ipynb* provides approximate solutions to the [Acoustic Wave Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_wave_equation), but the notebook remains incomplete, as I never printed this solutions to MIDI. The unrealized idea here is that the changes in the velocity of the charged particles would produces waves in an ambient field.
